//! `pod-mods` — Pod's extension system (docs/16).
//!
//! Small sandboxed JavaScript mods (QuickJS via rquickjs) that react to
//! daemon events, add palette commands, detect agent status from terminal
//! screens and titles, and ship declarative layout presets. Every host call
//! goes through a permission and scope check; each mod has its own memory
//! and CPU limits and is stopped, not the host, when it misbehaves.
//!
//! The embedding daemon implements [`Host`] and drives a `ModHandle`
//! (feature `runtime`, default). Without it only the manifest, host and wire
//! types build (for clients of the daemon).
